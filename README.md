## License

Based on [pjkundert/cpppo](https://github.com/pjkundert/cpppo), which is available under the below license. I guess this makes this GPLv3 as well.

> Cpppo is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3 and is also
> available under alternative licenses negotiated directly with Hard Consulting
> Corporation. If you obtained Cpppo under the GPL, then the GPL applies to all
> Cpppo modules used on your system as well, except as defined below. The GPL
> (version 3) is included in this source tree in the file COPYING.
> 
> Hard Consulting Corporation holds copyright and/or sufficient licenses to all
> components of the Cpppo package, and therefore can grant, at its sole
> discretion, the ability for companies, individuals, or organizations to create
> proprietary or Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may use at runtime
> the portions of Cpppo which fall under our copyright/license umbrella, or
> are distributed under more flexible licenses than GPL.
> 
> If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry -- there is no
> requirement that you provide the same exception in your GPL'd products (although

> In addition, Cpppo implements many other communications protocols.  It is our
> belief that applications using these protocols to manage or control a Cpppo
> instance do not have to be licensed under the GPL or a compatible license, as we
> believe these protocols do not create a 'derivative work' as referred to in the
> GPL.  However, should any court or other judiciary body find that these
> protocols do fall under the terms of the GPL, then we hereby grant you a license
> to use these protocols in combination with Cpppo in external applications
> licensed under any license you wish.

A copy of GPLv3 is found in the file COPYING in this repo too.
